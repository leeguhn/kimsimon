I am intrigued by the ever present nature of performance; or, in the perpetual role of a spectator every human being takes on in their everyday life. It is not a matter of consent - we are simply born into the assignment. 

My performances do not have a fourth wall or a clear separation between the performer and the audience. They are melting pots in which distinct sensibilities of my works in different media are fused and merged to build a stage that I, as a performer, am unfamiliar with.
