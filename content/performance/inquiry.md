At a departmental critique, three volunteers were given a porcelain ball to feel in their hands with their eyes closed with the following prompt: 

“Think of someone or something you know you need to let go, but you can’t let go right now. I ask you to think of it until you can see it in your head. Once you do, please let me know.”

When all participants affirmed their readiness, they were permitted to open their eyes again. I asked the one who took the most time to be ready whether I could take the ball back. Upon retrieving it, I threw it as hard as I could at the center of a white institutional wall. A dent remains.
