Chicaco Architecture Biennial 5 @ Chicago Cultural Center

Throughout the open hours on the last two Sundays of the Chicago Architecture Biennial, I moved my belongings and a foldable table into the Gray Veil (designed by WOJR). I dribbled around the site as visitors came by. I presented opportunities for a performance-for-one to everyone, with each iteration determined by their choice among the small objects I laid out in front of them on the table - as well as the valuable input and presence provided by each participant.
