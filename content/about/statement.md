I am an artist from Seoul, South Korea. I have recently completed my MFA at the University of Chicago (DoVA) and relocated to New York City. 

My nomadic upbringing has led me to pay attention to the spatial and emotional gaps that are present between people, objects, and everything else. My practice is driven by a deep curiosity for how this inherently human and personal subject can be transmuted into form, color, and space. Technology has been a companion and mirror since childhood, and I often find my art adopting genetic, algorithmic, and planetary themes.

I often distill patterns of human behavior and biological phenomena into modules of lines and geometries. These fragments are then spliced into new orientations in a range of physical and digital media - I carry across what I learn from one to the other, and back. Emotion, language, and relations function as the building blocks of an alphabet that I shuffle to produce each work.
