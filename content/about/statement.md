I am an artist from Seoul, South Korea, currently based in Seoul and New York City. I am a recent MFA graduate from the Department of Visual Arts (DoVA) at the University of Chicago. 

My practice is driven by a deep curiosity for how emotion and culture can be explored through form, color, and dimension. My nomadic upbringing informs the way I examine the subtle, invisible mechanisms within oneself, between bodies, and of the world. Making images, objects, and experiences is a means for me to document my feelings and thoughts on this subject.   

Working across ceramics, drawing, painting, performance, and digital media, my work develops in a feedback loop between the physical and virtual. Technology has been a companion and a mirror since childhood, and my art often embodies linguistic, algorithmic, and biological characteristics. Cultivating a visual language that is modular, porous, and open for engagement is central to the development of my work.

My works have recently been presented at the Chicago Architecture Biennial 5, IDKF (Internationales Digitalkunst Festival), the University of Chicago, and Grinnell College Museum of Art.
