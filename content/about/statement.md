I am an artist from Seoul, South Korea, currently based in Seoul and New York City. I am a recent MFA graduate from the Department of Visual Arts (DoVA) at the University of Chicago. 

My practice is driven by a deep curiosity for how emotion and culture manifest through form, dimension, and spatial experiences. My nomadic upbringing informs the way I examine the subtle and often invisible relation between people, objects, and spaces. 

Working across ceramics, drawing, painting, performance, and digital media, my works develop in a feedback loop between the physical and virtual. Technology has been a companion and a mirror since childhood, and my art often embodies linguistic, algorithmic, and biological characteristics. 

My works have recently been presented at the Chicago Architecture Biennial 5, IDKF (Internationales Digitalkunst Festival), and the University of Chicago.
