I am an artist from Seoul, South Korea. I have recently completed my MFA at the University of Chicago (DoVA) and relocated to New York City. 

My nomadic upbringing has led me to pay attention to the spatial and emotional gaps that are present between people, objects, and everything else. My practice is driven by a deep curiosity for how this inherently human and personal subject can be transmuted into form, color, and space. Technology has been a companion and friend for me since childhood, and I often find my art adopting genetic, algorithmic, and planetary themes.

I distill patterns of human behavior and biological phenomena into modules of lines and geometries. These fragments are then spliced into new orientations in a range of physical and digital media. Emotion, language, and relatinoships function as the vowels, consonants, and numerals of an alphabet that I shuffle in a variety of combinations to create each work. Every new form that I produce helps to continuously redefine the vocabulary of my visual language. 

My works are my meditations on a civilization accelerating at a pace never encountered before. They are responses to the complex and multifaceted nature of the human experience as one navigates their body through relationships, cultures, and environments. I hope that the work I release to the physical and digital realms of today can offer a perspective of our time to the people of tomorrow.
