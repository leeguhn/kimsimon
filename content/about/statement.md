I am an artist from Seoul, South Korea. I have recently completed my MFA at the University of Chicago (DoVA) and relocated to New York City. 

My nomadic upbringing has led me to pay attention to the spatial and emotional gaps that are present within and between people and everything else. My practice is driven by a deep curiosity for how this inherently human and personal subject can be explored in terms of form, color, and space.

I analyze my observations of human behavior and biological phenomena and distill them into modules of lines, patterns, and geometries. These fragments are then spliced into new orientations in a range of physical and digital media. They function as the vowels, consonants, and numerals of an alphabet that I shuffle in a variety of combinations to create each work. Every new form that I produce helps to continuously redefine the vocabulary of my visual language. 

I am interested in the perceptual and sensorial effects that materials can have on the observer. I study topics of affect, religion, philosophy, quantum physics, and neuroaesthetics as I conceptualize my work. I look to others from various walks of life for input, and their observations merge into my work, fused with my own sensibilities in the artistic process. Technology has been a companion and friend for me since childhood, and I often find my art adopting genetic, algorithmic, and planetary themes.

My works are my meditations on a civilization accelerating at a pace never encountered before. They are responses to the complex and multifaceted nature of the human experience as one navigates their body through relationships, cultures, and environments. I hope that the work I release to the physical and digital realms of today can offer a perspective of our time to the people of tomorrow.
